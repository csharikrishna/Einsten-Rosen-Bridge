# Cosmic Wormhole Experience

This project is a high-quality, interactive 3D web application that visualizes a traversable wormhole (an Einstein-Rosen bridge). It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Three.js library for 3D graphics.

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Scene:** A visually impressive and animated wormhole, surrounded by a procedurally generated starfield, nebulae, planets, and galaxies.
- **User Controls:** Users can manipulate the view with the mouse, zoom with the scroll wheel, and adjust the wormhole's "space distortion" via a slider.
- **Journey Mode:** An automated, cinematic fly-through of the wormhole.
- **Polished UI:** A sleek, futuristic user interface with "glassmorphism" effects, providing information and controls.
- **High Performance:** The code is heavily optimized for performance, using techniques like procedural generation and an efficient animation loop.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, you need to serve the files on a local web server due to browser security policies regarding JavaScript modules (`file:///` URLs will not work).

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the root directory where `index.html` is located.
4.  Run the following command to start a simple web server:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

5.  Open your web browser and navigate to the address `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Credits

This project is an impressive demonstration of what can be achieved with Three.js and modern web technologies. The original code is well-structured, highly optimized, and demonstrates a great deal of skill and creativity.
